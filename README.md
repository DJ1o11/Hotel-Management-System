Key Features of the Project:

1. Hotel Management: Add/Edit/Delete hotels, view hotel details.
2. Room Management: Add/Edit/Delete rooms, view room details.
3. Guest Management: Add/Edit/Delete guests, view guest details.
4. Reservation Management: Make new reservations, view reservation details, check room availability for specific dates.

Approach to Code:

1. Database Design (MySQL):
   • Four tables: Hotel, Room, Guest, and Reservation.
   • The database will establish relationships using foreign keys.
2. Backend (Java):
   • Entity Classes: Each table (Hotel, Room, Guest, Reservation) will have its entity class with appropriate
   attributes, constructors, and getter/setter methods.
   • DatabaseConnector: A class responsible for managing the database connection using JDBC.
   • DAO Classes: Each entity will have a DAO class to perform CRUD operations.
   • Business Logic: Logic to handle room availability checks, reservation costs, etc.
3. Frontend (Swing GUI):
   • Design intuitive forms for adding and managing hotels, rooms, guests, and reservations.
   • Use tables to display details (e.g., hotel details, reservation details).
   • Handle events like button clicks to perform CRUD operations via DAOs.

Detailed Project Structure:

1. MySQL Database Schema:
   • Hotel Table: Stores hotel details (name, location, amenities).
   • Room Table: Stores room details (room number, type, price, status).
   • Guest Table: Stores guest details (name, email, phone number).
   • Reservation Table: Tracks reservations (guest ID, room ID, check-in and check-out dates).
2. Java Classes:
   • DatabaseConnector.java: Handles the connection to the MvSQL database.
   • Entity Classes (e.g., Hotel.java): Defines hotel attributes (id, name, location, etc.).
   • DAO Classes (e.g., HotelDAO.java): Provides methods to add, update, delete, and retrieve hotels from the database.
   • Business Logic (Reservation handling, room availability check): Implement functionality to calculate the cost of a reservation and check room availability based on dates.
3. Swing GUI:
   • Main Window (JFrame): Acts as the entry point for user interactions.
   • Panels for Different Features:
     - Hotel Panel: Add, edit, delete hotels and view details.
     - Room Panel: Add, edit, delete rooms and view details.
     - Guest Panel: Add, edit, delete guests and view details.
     - Reservation Panel: Make reservations, view reservation details, and check availability.
